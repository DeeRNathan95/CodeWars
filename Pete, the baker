Pete likes to bake some cakes. He has some recipes and ingredients. Unfortunately he is not good in maths. Can you help him to find out, how many cakes he could bake considering his recipes?

Write a function cakes(), which takes the recipe (object) and the available ingredients (also an object) and returns the maximum number of cakes Pete can bake (integer). For simplicity there are no units for the amounts (e.g. 1 lb of flour or 200 g of sugar are simply 1 or 200). Ingredients that are not present in the objects, can be considered as 0.

Examples:

// must return 2
cakes({flour: 500, sugar: 200, eggs: 1}, {flour: 1200, sugar: 1200, eggs: 5, milk: 200}); 
// must return 0
cakes({apples: 3, flour: 300, sugar: 150, milk: 100, oil: 100}, {sugar: 500, flour: 2000, milk: 2000});


===========================================================================================

function cakes(recipe, available) {
  let maxCakes = Infinity
  
  for (let ingredient in recipe) { //loops through each keys in the object of recipe (flour, sugar...etc)
    if (!available[ingredient]){ //if the ingredient isnt in the available - it will return 0 - no cakes.
    return 0
  }
  //want to divide ingredient of available against receipt to find out how many cakes Pete can bake with it
  let possibleCakes = Math.floor(available[ingredient] / recipe[ingredient])
  //then whilst it's looping through each ingredients i want it to pick the smallest max number Pete can bake based on each ingredients
   maxCakes = Math.min(maxCakes, possibleCakes)   
  }
  return maxCakes  
}


============================================================

function cakes(recipe, available) {
  return Object.keys(recipe).reduce(function(val, ingredient) {
    return Math.min(Math.floor(available[ingredient] / recipe[ingredient] || 0), val)
  }, Infinity)  
}
