Sentence Smash
Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

Example
['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'




==========================================
Solution:

// Smash Words
function smash (words) {
    "use strict";
    return words.join(' ');
};



=========================================

Notes:

In the code above, join(' ') adds a space between each word, forming a complete sentence. You can adjust the separator as needed (e.g., ', ' for a comma-separated list).
