===========
  
Write funcion lenR which returns the length of a given list. Try no to cheat and provide recursive solution.
=========
function lenR(x) {
  if (x.length === 0) return 0; // base case
  return 1 + lenR(x.slice(1));  // recursive case
} 
================


✅ You said:

“The 1 is basically looking at the first element from the array?”

Yes — kind of, but with a small twist:

The 1 doesn’t store or use that first element’s value (like x[0]).

It just represents the fact that the first element exists — it’s a count for that element.
So it’s saying:

“I’ve found one element here — add 1 to the total.”

So:
🟩 The 1 = “this element exists” (not its value)

✅ You also said:

“Then x.slice(1) removes the first element and counts the rest of the elements?”

Exactly right ✔️

Let’s break that down precisely:

x.slice(1) means “make a new array that starts from index 1.”

So if x = [1, 2, 3, 4], then x.slice(1) becomes [2, 3, 4].

Then lenR(x.slice(1)) is a recursive call to count how many elements are left after the first one.


Literally means: return 1 + lenR(x.slice(1));


“Count the first element (that’s the +1),
and then count how many are left by calling the same function again on the rest of the array.”
